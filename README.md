# Nbyula-job-postings
The project aims to :-
  display job postings as flash cards on the user side.
  Create,edit and delete Jobs from the admin side
The user is directed to the user page or admin page based on their login.
In the user page the user can view and apply for jobs 
In the admin page the admin can view interested users and the currect jobs posted 

The front-end was made with HTML and Js
The back-end was supposed to be with python but due to time crisis and to avoid mislead with the view flow the backend was deleted.
